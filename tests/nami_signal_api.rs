//! The nami pin regression: the manifest declares `nami = "=0.11.1"` and
//! `[patch.crates-io]` redirects it to the rev carrying nami#26, where
//! `Signal::get` is `Signal::snapshot` and `Binding::get` is gone. A graph
//! that resolves any other nami — a pre-rename release or a second copy —
//! fails to compile this file rather than silently dropping the pin.
//!
//! The crate is Windows-only, so the test compiles only there; the backend's
//! CI runs it on a Windows host.
